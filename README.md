# Image Filter

![Image Filter](Images/Image%20Filter.png)

Image Filter is a program for everyone to apply filters to the image of their choice. We are currently offering 6 artistic filters: *Grayscale*, *Vignette*, *Sepia*, *Pencil Sketch*, *Gaussian Grain*, and *Image Mosiac*. The last one is most fascinating and I'd recommend you trying that out.
